<p class ="ingress">
We in iGEM Lund wanted to educate the public about synthetic biology and our project and thought of the most efficient ways to do so. We also wanted to make sure we targeted a broad range of audiences, ranging from the youth to university students to the general public. We can happily say that we’ve done so, and that we’re proud to have contributed in spreading awareness about synthetic biology and science.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<h4 class="js-toc-ignore"><a href="/Public_Engagement#summer-science-camp">AstraZeneca Summer science camp</a></h4>
<p>
In means to engage the youth in synthetic biology we collaborated with iGEM Stockholm. We conducted laborations and held lectures relating to synthetic biology and our project for students at a summer science camp.
</p>
<h4 class="js-toc-ignore"><a href="/Public_Engagement#articles">Articles</a></h4>
<p>
To engage university students we realized through peer investigation that articles was an efficient way to reach a broad audience. Throughout our project, we’ve been posting articles on our blog. The articles aim to educate other students on many aspects of synthetic biology and our project.
</p>
<h4 class="js-toc-ignore"><a href="/Public_Engagement#bioethics-project">Bioethics Project</a></h4>
<p>
What started as a collaborative effort between iGEM Lund, iGEM Copenhagen and iGEM Stockholm with the aim to update the current lacking legislation and regulations with regards to genetically modified probiotics, grew to become a collaboration regarding bio-ethical concerns. The aim of the project was to educate and engage in discussion with students, the general public and the layman.
</p>
<h4 class="js-toc-ignore"><a href="/Public_Engagement#podcast">Podcast</a></h4>
<p>
With podcast growing more and more popular amongst the youth but also the general public, we thought it would be a great platform to spread awareness about synthetic biology. We invited several iGEM-teams and other parties of interest to join and be a part of our project.
</p>
<h4 class="js-toc-ignore"><a href="/Public_Engagement#events">Events we've attended</a></h4>
<p>
During the course of our project we attended the BioBrick event hosted by the BioBuilders (iGEM DTU) and the NiC conference hosted by iGEM Team Copenhagen.
</p>
<h2 id="summer-science-camp">AstraZeneca Summer Science Camp</h2>
<p>iGEM Lund collaborated with iGEM Stockholm in contacting and preparing a visit to Astrazeneca summer science camp. On the twenty fifth of June, two members of iGEM Lund team travelled to KTH, Stockholm with the Stockholm iGEM team to meet the students of the Astrazeneca science summer camp. The thought behind the collaboration is to engage the curious minds of teenage students in a fun and interactive way. Therefore, instead of giving them a cryptic lecture on synthetic biology, we had them conduct experiments on their own with our guidance and assistance. From performing transformations on bacteria to plating them and then testing their antibiotic resistance, the students tinkered with most of the basic tools and procedures one would find in a synthetic biology lab. After every experiment they performed, we demonstrated through a short talk how the science is applied in the real world and what they can do to further develop this field and help protect against antibiotic resistance as mere students. To wrap up our event, both teams Lund and Stockholm presented their iGEM project to the students and engaged with them through a Q&A where the students showcased great interest in the whole topic. Overall, it was a successful event where we managed to engage the youth in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

<h3 id="biobrick-tutorial">Biobrick Tutorial at DTU</h3>
<p>
In early April, the iGEM Lund team was invited to attend the BioBrick tutorial hosted by DTU in their Lyngby campus. The event was held at a time when most teams were still in their early tracks and hadn’t started any lab work. In turn, this incentivized the organizers to come up with very creative and engaging ideas. Ranging from seminars given by previous iGEM participants about their experiences to lab-work where inexperienced people got together with experienced ones from different teams and worked together on basic synthetic biology techniques. The schedule they planned out kept us excited and intrigued. All in all, the experience allowed every member from the Lund iGEM team to feel the sense of community that belongs to people working in the domain of synthetic biology. For members that had no clue what a grown colony of bacteria looks like, the carefully instructed program they planned out gave them close insight and grew their interest and curiosity. This is also where the cooperation between iGEM Lund and iGEM Copenhagen began.
</p>
<h3 id="nic">Nordic iGEM Conference</h3>
<p>
Not long after the BioBrick tutorial, the Lund iGEM team revisited Copenhagen to participate in the Nordic iGEM Conference. We got to catch up with teams and people we had met in the previous event and share our progress with them. We were met with a welcoming attitude that furthered the sense of community we had experienced previously. In general, the event was aimed at teaching science communication and how to convey our findings as scientists to the general population. Every team presented their project idea and received constructive feedback from the judges and other participants. In addition to that, teams had prepared posters that captured the essence of their projects. Some of these posters were very aesthetically pleasing and memorable such as UCPH’s poster of their gum that tests fertility. During the weekend we had our first physical meeting with iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Copenhagen regarding our cooperation. We left Copenhagen after that weekend excited to meet these teams again and catch up on their progress as well as share ours with them.
