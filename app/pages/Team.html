            <p>The only male part of the wet lab team. Mateusz was the main designer of the gene constructs. It was a great burden to carry but he did it effortlessly. He’s main scope this summer was to tease the girls in the lab and complain about coming to the lab early in the morning. The great mind of the lab has a deep background in biotechnology and he will complete his master’s in the same field at LTH in 2020. </p>

            <h5>Bachelor in Biotechnology</h5>
            <p>Julia is a circus artist by day and a lab hero by night. Literally. She has a special fondness for cellular biology, and knows how to practice it. She is a core member of the wetlab focus group, where she’s been she involved in the design and execution of experiments.  What would the lab group be without her? She is, as of 2019, doing a master’s in biotechnology at LTH. </p>

            <h5>Master in Biotechnology</h5>
            <p>Savvina intimidates most members of the team with her Basilisk sight, no wonder since she is a proud Slytherin and that means something. She can complain about literally anything but she does it for the greater good, to make sure that the team is on the right track. She can cook and bake quite well, so she makes sure that no one is hungry in our team! Also, she has no abs and cannot lie. She studied food technology and worked in quality control but decided recently to change her area of expertise to biotechnology. Savvina was responsible for the safety in the lab. She sacrificed a lot of her free time to come on weekends and inoculate the cultures, run the SDS-page, etc. So we appreciate it a lot!</p>

    <h2 id="supervisors" style="margin-top: 5em">Supervisors</h2>
    <h3>Nélida Leiva Eriksson</h3>
    <p>Nélida has been there for us since day one, providing us with guidance and support in all forms. Her willingness to help us whenever needed, giving valuable inputs and thoughts, has allowed us to stay motivated and continuously move forward with our project. Her current research focuses on the understanding of the activity of heme-proteins and their subsequent biotechnological application in medicine, food science, and agriculture</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Johan Svensson Bonde</h3>
    <p>Johan has been of great help, giving us a thorough walk-through of the equipment, as well as crucial safety instructions. He has also provided us with guidance and support and overall been an essential part of the team. Right now, Johan is working on developing and using engineered recombinant proteins as biomaterials, and to control biomineralization.</p>
