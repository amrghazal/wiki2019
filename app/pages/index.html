    <p class="ingress" >We at <b>iGEM Lund 2019</b> have genetically modifying a probiotic bacteria - <b><i>E. coli</i> Nissle 1917</b> - to increase its ability to absorb and accumulate <b>lead and arsenic</b>. Lead and arsenic, among many other toxic metals are generating problems across the globe, especially in countries with poor water infrastructure such as Bangladesh and Argentina. Our product, <b>PRODEACC</b>, could be a natural and sustainable remedy to prevent toxic metal-poisoning by disposing them from your body and returning them to earth. The probiotic bacteria will enter the gut and GI-tract and act as a sponge, absorbing and accumulating lead, arsenic and mercury. It will then be excreted through natural pathways, thus removing the toxic metals from your body. With a proof of concept established, our method could be implemented in various bacteria acting on numerous metals or toxic substances.  </p>

    <h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
    <p>We're focusing on the two toxic metals: arsenic and lead. For each toxic metal we’ve identified the pathways of transport and accumulation in means of overexpressing some of the necessary proteins involved. We're doing so by introducing plasmids, one for each toxic metal. <a href="/Team:Lund/Description">Read more...</a></p>

    <p>By modelling the bodies uptake of metals we have investigated the effectiveness of PRODEACC. We can use our models to estimate the effectiveness of PRODEACC in the real life. <a href="/Model">Read more...</a></p>
