<h1 id="title" class="js-toc-ignore">Mathematical models for predicting the long term health benefits of using PRODEACC</h1>
<div id="body">
    <p>To better understand the long term health benefits of PRODEACC consumption, mathematical models of transformed <em>E. coli </em>Nissle 1917 colonies were developed. Unknown parameters were estimated using parameter optimization against data collected from in-vitro experiments. Once the models could predict the toxic metal bioaccumulation in a single colony, they could be integrated into existing models describing how lead and arsenic are bio-accumulated in the human body. By comparing the output of the modified body accumulation models to the output of the non-modified model, the long term effects of PRODEACC could be assessed. <strong>The modeling team has worked in conjunction with the lab group to reach this goal. In the beginning, it was planned to study the deaccumulating effects of PRODEACC on worms in order to assess the long term benefits. This id&eacute;a was discarded in favor of using computer models. The computer model has, therefore, had a huge impact on the lab work by alleviating this opportunity cost.</strong></p>

<h2 id="Modeling-growth-and-ion-accumulation in a singel colony">Bioaccumulation in a Bacteria Colony</h2>

<p>
To model the growth of a single colony, its protein production, and its ions accumulation, a system of seven differential equations was devised. Equation (1) and (2) describes the colony as a whole and the concentration of ions in its growth medium, whereas equation (3) - (7) describes the changes inside the average individual cell. A graphical representation of the equation can be found in figure x. Short descriptions of the time-dependent variables can be found in table x and descriptions and approximate values of the parameters can be found in table 1.

<h3 id="derivatoin-of-equations">Derivation of equations</h3>
<p>
The model was devised to simulate the colony in a number of conditions, with only the values of the parameters needed to be changed. For example, for the growth rate <i>k<sub>growth</sub></i> would most likely be lower in a gut environment compared to an in-vitro environment with good pH and no competition from other microbes.
<p>
<br>

<b>Equation (1)</b> describes the rate of change of the total number of living bacteria cells in the colony. The cells are assumed to divide at a constant rate kgrowth after the lag phase is over. However, the exponential growth will not continue forever. At some point, the lack of energy will force the colony to stop dividing and will reach a stationary phase. Because of this, the term <i>−k<sub>growth</sub>&times N <sup>2</sup>/N<sub>max</sub></i> was introduced making the growth rate stagnate once <i>N</i> reaches <i>N<sub>max</sub></i> [1].
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Equation (2)</b> describes the rate of change of the total number of lead or arsenic ions in the gut (or growth medium). The rate of accumulation by the colony should be a function of the number of living cells <i>N</i>, as well as the number of transport proteins per cell. The working mechanisms for the lead/iron transporter pbrT are unknown[2].  The Michaelis–Menten equation was used in to represent the transport rate with the rational that a higher concentration of ions outside the cells would increase the probability of an ion finding its way through a transporter, but that the increment would give diminishing returns one more and more transporters work at their highest capacity.[3]
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Equation (2)</b> describes the change in the number of mRNAs coding for the accumulation proteins and the transport proteins. The transcription rate Itsc is assumed to be constant once the promoter has been induced. Then the mRNA will degrade att the kinetic rate kRNA-deg.
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Equation (2)</b> describes the rate of change in the number of transport proteins per cell. The proteins are translated from the mRNAs at a kinetic rate ktsl. The proteins are assumed to degrade at the kinetic rate kpro-deg. The kinetic rate -dN/dT/N was introduced to take into account the effective degradation due to cell growth. Every time a cell divides the average number of proteins in one cell is halved. These kinetics apply the other proteins as well.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Equation (5)</b> describes the rate change in the number of free accumulation proteins. Whenever an accumulation protein binds to an ion, the accumulation protein is no longer free. This rate is proportional to the number of accumulation proteins APfree and the number of free ions in cytoplasm C. The kinetic rate kcapture was introduced to scale the rate of capture.
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Equation (6)</b> describes the rate of change in the number of occupied accumulation proteins, the proteins bound to an ion. The kinetics are similar to that of equation (5).
</p>

<p>
<b>Equation (7)</b> describes the rate of change in the number of free ions in the cytoplasm.

<h3 id="parameter-optimization">Parameter Optimization</h3>
<p>
Values for the parameters that couldn't be found in the literature were estimated using data acquired from experiments. The model could be fitted to the data with the help of optimization algorithms. The acquired parameter values were the ones that yielded the lowest cost from a linear loss function. To find the lowest cost adaptive particle swarm algorithm was used[4]. Particle swarm optimization has been used with good efficiency for other non-linear ODE-parameter estimation for biological systems, where there's a big solution space [5].

<h3 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
<p>When having a complex system of inputs and outputs, it’s difficult to know which inputs have more effects on the outputs. Insight on how to adjust the system to a preferred output can be acquired via sensitivity analysis, in this case how to improve the probiotic’s ability to accumulate metals. Several parameters in the colony model have the potential to be critical, such as  <i>k<sub>ca</sub></i> (the capture rate of accumulation protein, which does not have an importance in the current state of this model), <i>k<sub>m</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> (the rate constants for transport protein), or <i>k<sub>growth</sub></i> and <i>N<sub>max</sub></i> (the growth rate and the maximum concentration of the bacteria colony), etc. So knowing the importance of these parameters for the de-accumulating effect is also knowing which part of the bacteria colony should be focused on for future improvement. It can either the accumulation protein, the transport protein or the survival of bacteria itself. In order to do that, sensitivity analysis is carried out on the model.</p>
<br>
<p>In particular, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method called Sobol is used, which is a variance-based analysis. GSA allows us to vary all the parameters simultaneously to evaluate their relative contribution to the model outputs as well as their interaction with each other [6]. Unlike local sensitivity analysis, which only allows for the evaluation of one parameter at a time. The steps for Sobol analysis are described in the figure below.</p>

<p class="fig">Figure 1: Pre-Sobol and Sobol sensitivity analysis steps [6]</p>

<p>Before doing sensitivity analysis on parameters, it’s critical to estimate the sensible ranges of them since the analysis would inform the importance of parameters within the ranges. Range estimation is described in table 5. Furthermore, 5000 samples are taken for each parameter within its range. The higher the number of samples is, the more accurate the analysis is. 5000 seems to be a good number of samples for each for a complex system [6].</p>

<h2 id="body-uptake">Bioaccumulation in the human body</h2>
<p>
The human body uptake models show how much toxic metal accumulates in different organs of the body. Each of them consists of a system of differential equations, where each differential equation describes the rate of change of the amount of toxic metal in one compartment. A compartment can be either an organ or an excretion pool. We implemented the body uptake models, for arsenic and lead, based on a paper by Eric Dede, published in 2018 [7].
</p>
<h3 id="arsenic">Arsenic</h3>
<p>
The arsenic body uptake model is adopted from El-Masri and Kenyon (2008) [8] with some modification. In the model, there are 12 compartments that are taken into consideration as seen in figure 1. The figure describes the dynamics between the compartments with first-order rate constants (The constants are left out in this figure for clarity but can be found in Dede 2018. A first-order reaction has a rate proportional to the concentration of one reactant [9], meaning the higher the concentration of a toxic metal is, the faster it is being transferred to other compartments.
</p>
<img class="fig" src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/8/81/T--Lund--arsenic-model.svg" alt="">
<p class="fig">Figure 2: Overview of compartements and their relations in the arsenic body uptake model.</p>
<p>
The model also takes into account that arsenic exists in different forms in the human body. They can be inorganic ions, either As(III) or As(V), or organic forms like monomethyl arsenic acid (MMA) and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA). There are reactions taking place in the body such that one form of arsenic is converted to another so extra terms are added to the differential equations for that. Since the model contains 12 compartments and 4 forms of arsenic, there’s a total of 48 equations in the system of differential equations, 12 for each of the form of arsenic.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The full system of differential equations including the rate constants can be found in the supplementary materials of Dede et al [7]. To make sure there were no mistakes in the implementation, results were compared to examples in the original paper.
</p>
<h3 id="lead">Lead</h3>
<p>The body uptake model for lead was originally developed during the 1990s[10][11][12], it was later modified in 2018[7]. There are ten compartments, seven of which are organs while the other three are excretion pools, as seen in figure 3. </p>

<p class="fig">Figure 3: Overview of compartements and their relations in non-modfied the lead body uptake model.</p>
To make sure there were no mistakes in the implementation, results were compared to examples in the original paper, when given the same input.
<br>
<p>To illustrate how lead accumulates in different organs over many years, an animation was created using data given by the model, see animation 2.  This animation illustrates the accumulation when the daily intake is 11.4 µg, over 8 years. After 8 years the accumulation reaches a steady-state for this dose.</p>

<h2 class="integrate">Integration of Colony Model into Human Body Model</h2>
<p>The colony models could be integrated into the human body uptake models by adding the colony as a compartment connected to the gut compartment. This way the bacteria colony will compete against the liver when absorbing the metals from the gut. Some assumptions are made for the integration:
<ol>
    <li>The bacteria colony in gut gets excreted out daily.</li>
    <li>New bacteria colony is consumed daily.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3 id="arsenic2">Arsenic</h3>
<p>The colony model was integrated by adding the colony model as a compartment resulting in a model that can be overview in figure 4.
</p>

<p class="fig">Figure 4: An overview of the bacteria colony integrated human body uptake model for arseic.</p>

<h3 id="lead2">Lead</h3>
<p>To integrate the colony uptake model into the body uptake it first had to be modified. The original-, modified- and colony integrated versions of the GI-tract-liver dynamics can be seen in figure 5.</p>

<img class="fig" src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/3/34/T--Lund--model-mod.svg" alt="">
<p class="fig">Figure 5: Overview of the original liver-gut compartment, the modified liver-gut compartement, and the colony model integrated liver-gut compartement.</p>
<br>

<p>In the original version, the oral lead intake was described as a constant rate <i>IR<sub>gi</sub></i>. The rate being absorbed by the liver was described as a fraction of the daily intake. Which means it tells how much of lead is being absorbed daily but not how fast. To integrate the colony uptake model, these dynamics had to be replaced by first-order kinetic rates, similar to the rates found in the body uptake model for arsenic. The daily intake <i>IR<sub>gi</sub></i> was then set as an initial condition for the GI tract differential equation. The model could then be solved piecewise, each time with the initial condition <i>G(0) = IR<sub>gi</sub></i>. The original (8) and the modified (9) equation for the gut-compartement can be seen below.</p>
<br>

<p class="maths">
<dtex>\frac{dG}{dt} = IR_{gi} - A_{gi} \times IR_{gi} - (1-A_{gi}) \times IR_{gi} = 0 </dtex> 
<dtex>\frac{dG}{dt} = -k_{GF} \times IR_{gi} - k_{GB} \times G </dtex> 
</p>
<p>The values for <i>k<sub>GF</sub></i> and <i>k<sub>GL</sub></i> could not be found in the literature. To find the values for these rates, while preserving the model's predictability, the parameter optimization, as described earlier, was used.</p>
<br>
<p>After the modification, the colony uptake model could be integrated into the lead uptake model, just as in the case with arsenic, resulting in a model that can be overviewed in figure 6.</p>

<h3>Accumulation in the Human Body</h3>
<p>The amount of accumulated arsenic in various organs, with and without the probiotic, can be seen in figure 11 and 12. Figure 11 shows the accumulation after 30 days with a daily intake of 15 mcg, whle figure 12 shows the accumulation after 30 days with a daily intake of 50 mcg, which is the amount that the general population takes in [15]. The average relative reduction for these scenarios was 83% and 25% respectively.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>In this section, we will discuss the results presented in the previous section.</p>
<h3>Fitted Parameters and Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
<p>It is difficult to assess the validity of the parameters in the colon model. More data would need to be collected to know for sure that the parameters are valid. We think it is highly unlikely that <i>k<sub>m</sub></i>, for arsenic and lead, is correct since it was found by only fitting the model to a single concentration, and since <i>k<sub>m</sub></i> is the concentration at which the transport rate is half of <i>V<sub>max</sub></i>. To assess <i>k<sub>m</sub></i>, one would need many different concentrations when fitting. This would be possible with more, and better, data from the wet lab, but since we outsource the MS-ICP testing to Eurofins, we could not afford more samples. Howecer, from the sensitivity analysis (figure 11) it's evident that the <i>k<sub>m</sub></i> has a very low effect on the outcome. Therefore, the low uncertainty of the exact value should not have a significant effect on the model's predictability.</p>
<br>
<p>The values for <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> was found to be about two orders of magnitude over the one found for a different transport protein in Ehrenberg and Kurland (1988). We have not been able to judge if our values are beyond reason or not</p>
<br>
<p>We have strong confidence in the parameters fitted for the human body uptake model for lead. We tried to reach the authors of the original model, and other experts, to comment on our modification, but without success.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="reduced-acc">Reduced Accumulation in Human Body</h3>
<p>From results, it is evident that the models suggest a significant relative decrease of accumulated lead when daily intake is around 11.4 µg of lead (figure 11), or 15 µg of arsenic (figure 14).</p>
<br>
<p>A daily intake of 11.4 µg is far above what is recommended for children by the American Food and Drug Administration (3 mcg)[13], but far lower than 114 mcg per day, which was observed to be the average daily intake in  Kanpur, India in 2005 [14]. For arsenic ic the daily average intake in the US is 50 µg. Since the model did not suggest a big accumulation reduction at these concentrations, we don't believe that this particular probiotic would be useful as a remedy against arsenic exposure. We also do not believe that it would work well against lead at high lead concentrations, for the same reasons (figure 13).</p>
<br>
<p>We think that it could be argued that there's a moderate possibility that a probiotic like PRODEACC could be usefull for humans that are moderatly exposed to lead, because the result in figure 14.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvments">Future Improvements</h3>
<p>The model we’ve developed can be improved in a number of ways. Here are some that we’ve acknowledged:</p>
<br>
<p>The colony model doesn’t take into account bacteria death due to the high concentration of metal in the cytoplasm. This would require another parameter describing the thresh-hold concentration of metal in cytoplasm for causing cell death.</p>
<br>
<p>With more data about metal concentration decrease, one could estimate the accumulation parameters with better precision. It would also make it easier to say how good the model represents the features of the colony. It is likely that the value for <i>k<sub>m</sub></i> is not accurate since the parameter optimization only was done for a single concentration of ions. With more samples from a variety of concentrations, a more accurate value for <i>k<sub>m</sub></i> would be yielded.</p>
<br>
<p>With data from the SDS-page one could estimate the number of expressed protein at different time points and then fit the model to that data to better represent the reality of the protein expression in this colony.</p>
<br>
<p>The colony uptake model is developed to from with the lead plasmid in mind, and applied to both lead and arsenic, despite the lack of overexpressed transport proteins in the arsenic plasmid. It, therefore, gives a better representation of the lead plasmid compared to the arsenic plasmid. With more time one could modify the model to better fit the arsenic vector.</p>
<br>
<p>The models are implemented in Julia 1.2, and all codes are <a href="https://github.com/igemlund">available on Github</a> for anyone to use or build upon.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Judging from the results, we believe that probiotics, genetically modified or otherwise, are an underappreciated tool for helping the body to get rid of toxic matter. More work needs to be done to evaluate if these particular GM-bacterias can be used in the future as toxic metal remediation. We strongly believe in the methodology used, although the execution can be much improved.</p>
